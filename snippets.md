## ▫️ **BASH**

### Zipping

* General unzip: `unzip path/to/your/file.zip`
* Unzip to specific path: `unzip path/to/your/file.zip -d path/to/destination/folder`

### tmux

#### Pane Management

* Split Pane Horizontally: `Ctrl + b, then "`
* Split Pane Vertically: `Ctrl + b, then %`
* Switch to x Pane: `Ctrl + b, then x-arrow`
* Close Current Pane: `Ctrl + b, then x (then press y to confirm)`
* (Switch to Next Pane: `Ctrl + b, then o)`

#### Window Management

* Create New Window: `Ctrl + b, then c`
* Switch to Next Window: `Ctrl + b, then n`
* Switch to Previous Window: `Ctrl + b, then p`
* List Windows: `Ctrl + b, then w`
* Rename Current Window: `Ctrl + b, then ,`

#### Session Management

* Detach from Session: `Ctrl + b, then d`
* List Sessions: `tmux ls (outside of tmux)`
* Attach to a Session: `tmux attach-session -t [session-name]`

#### Resizing Panes

* Resize Pane Up: `Ctrl + b:resize-pane -U 10`
* Resize Pane Down: `Ctrl + b:resize-pane -D 10`
* Resize Pane Left: `Ctrl + b:resize-pane -L 10`
* Resize Pane Right: `Ctrl + b:resize-pane -R 10`

#### Miscellaneous

## ▫️ **GIT**

### ghh CLI

* Create new repo: `gh repo create ___ --private`

### Commands

* Remove local already-pushed file from remote:

  ```git
  git rm --cached FILE_OR_DIR_NAME
  git commit -m "Removed FILE_OR_DIR_NAME from repository"
  git push origin master
  ```

* get git remote origin's url: `git config --get remote.origin.url`

---

## ▫️ **NUMPY**

### RESHAPING

* The reshape() function takes a single tuple argument that specifies the new shape of the array
  * Used frequently to _add_ a dimension of when for libs like sklearn and keras (to the END of the shape tuple -- i.e. **right-padding with 1s**)
* In the case of reshaping 1-D `(m,)` --> 2-D `(m,1)`:
  * Tuple would be the shape of the array as the first dimension (data.shape[0]) and 1 for the second dimension:
    * `data.shape == (m_old, )` (e.g. `(1000,)`)
    * `data = data.reshape( (m_old, n_new)  )`
      * `data.shape == (m_old, n_new)` (e.g. `(1000, 1)`)

### BROADCASTING

In formal LinAlg, arithmetic can only be performed when:  

* the shape of each dimension in the arrays are equal (even for dotproduct - though not matmul)
  
However, in ML, we often want to add **A** `(m,n)` to **v** `(,n)`.  
NumPy enables this by _broadcasting_ the vector to the shape of the matrix.  
Specifically np (**which considers vectors as (n,) since it is row-oriented**) effectively:

1. **Left-pads with 1s** the dimensions of the smaller array
2. **Right-to-left compares** the dimensions of the two arrays and ensures either
  a. The dimensions are equal **OR**
  b. At least one of the dimensions is 1
3. If all dimensions pass, np **replicates** (_broadcast_) the smaller array along the dim(s) where it is 1 to match the shape of the larger array.

**NOTE**: Broadcasting is not a copy operation. It is a view of the original array with the same data. This means that if you modify a broadcasted array, it modifies the original array.  

So for example:  

* 1-D vs. 2-D
  * LOOKS like comparing:  
    * A.shape -- (2,3)  
    * b.shape -- (3,)  
  * ACTUALLY np is comparing:  
    * A.shape -- (2,3)  
    * b.shape -- (1,3)  
* 2-D vs. scalar  
  * LOOKS like comparing:  
    * A.shape -- (2,3)  
    * b.shape -- (1,)  
  * ACTUALLY np is comparing:  
    * A.shape -- (2,3)  
    * b.shape -- (1,1)
